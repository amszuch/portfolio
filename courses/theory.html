								<h3>EECS 203: Discrete Mathematics</h3>
								<p>This course acts as an initial introduction to computer science theory and logic. The primary topics included modular arithmetic, the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, logical equivalence, natural deduction, proofs (by contraditions, contrapositive, and induction), relations and closures, permutations and combinations, partial orders, countability, and introductory graph theory. These fundamentals are required for continuation down a computer science engineering degree path.</p>
								<hr />

								<h3>EECS 376: Foundations of Computer Science</h3>
								<p>This is the final core computer science course for all undergraduate students. This course was broken up over five main subsections: algorithms (divide-and-conquer, Master Theorem, dynamic programming, greedy), computability (Turing machines, decideability, Turing reductions, recognizability), complexity (P, NP, Cook-Levin theorem, NP-completeness, NP-complete problems), randomness (randomized algorithms, probability, Monte Carlo methods), and introduction to cryptography (Diffie-Hellman, RSA).</p>
								<hr />
								
								<h3>EECS 498: Machine Learning Basics</h3>
								<p>This special topics course provided exposure to basic concepts used in machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. These included linear regression, logistic regression, non-linearity, overfitting, regularization, neural networks, loss functions, forward and back propagation, support vector machines (SVMs), supervised and unsupervised learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and large language models (LLMs). Each student was also tasked with leading discussions in class, and my topics were backpropagation in neural networsk, a vector-centric view of backpropagation, and text embedding using word2vec (continuous bag of words (CBOW) and skip-gram). This course was taught by Professor Mohammed Islam during the Fall 2023 semester.</p>
								<hr />

								<h3>CSE 575: Advanced Cryptography</h3>
								<p>As a masters student, I took the graduate cryptography course to build on my knowledge of the underlying schemes used in security applications. This class built throughout, including topics like computational hardness, one-way functions (including Rabin's collection), indistinguishability, the composition and hybrid lemmas, pseudorandom generators (PRGs) and functions (PRFs), symmetric-key encryption (SKE), IND-CPA security, authenticated encryption, public-key encryption (PKE), ElGamal encryption, Merkle-Damgard transform, interactive oracle proofs (IOPs), and PLONKish contraint systems. The course was taught by Assistant Professor Paul Grubbs during the Fall 2024 term.</p>
